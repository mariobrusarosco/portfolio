## Front End Developer

Hi, this is my personal portfolio project. It's under construction so new things will be shipped to
"production" pretty soon!

## Motivation

To make it easier for people to understand my work, interests, skills, projects, and experiences.

## Production URL

https://mariobrusarosco.vercel.app/

## Stack

A project using Next JS. Why?

To have a ready-to-go:

- React Environment
- CI/CD
- Server Rendered HTML for SEO purposes
- A custom domain
